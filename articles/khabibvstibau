          <p>With an official record of 28 wins and 0 losses, Khabib Nurmagomedov is celebrated today as a titan of mythical proportions, a type that is almost never encountered in the young sport of MMA. The casual fan imagines the Dagestani champion as an insurmountable challenge for his opponents who has never been bested and might never be truly challenged. Yet for all the praise and awe that Khabib receives from the hardcore MMA community, the dedicated fans of the sport are all too-familiar with that one fight where the grappler’s takedowns were completely thwarted and he was statistically outstruck and outwrestled by a bigger, stronger man from Brazil who would ultimately become a journeyman.</p>

          <p>In July of 2012, Glieason Tibau lost a decision against Khabib Nurmagomedov that was controversial to say the least. Figthmetric showed that Tibau landed more total and significant strikes than Khabib over the course of 3 rounds and stuffed 13 of his opponent’s takedowns while scoring 1 of his own. The majority of media scorecards went in favor of Tibau. Public fan polling showed that <a href="https://forums.sherdog.com/threads/did-khabib-deserve-a-loss-vs-gleison-tibau.3973239/" target="_blank">most people in general</a> were confused by the judges decision.</p>
          

          <h2 class="section-heading">In Conclusion</h2>

          <p>Anyone who embarks on a journey in a grappling sport should take measures to avoid cauliflower ear from the very beginning. To be able to enjoy the full benefits of wrestling, judo, or jiu-jitsu while minimizing the risks and negative consequences of these dangerous sports is a victory to be proud of. The leaders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu should recognize this view and allow competitors to wear ear guards in their tournaments as another step to maximize the health and safety of BJJ participants.
