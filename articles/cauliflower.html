          <p>There is a tendency in combat sports for athletes to carry their scars with pride. Bruises, cuts, and other injuries indicate that the fighter has trained hard and is tough enough to wear the marks of undergone pain with stoic indifference. The treatment of ‘cauliflower ears’ as a badge of honor in grappling sports is the ultimate example of such a culture that fails to prioritize health, longevity, and safety.</p>

          <p>If you were to ask most grapplers about the negative health effects of cauliflower ears, you’re likely to be told that there are none. Medical data, however, paints a different picture. Cauliflower ears increase the chances of hearing loss and infections. This information alone is enough to warrant preventative measures by both participants of grappling sports and also the regulatory bodies that exist to ensure the safety of athletes.</p>

          <p>This is where ear guards come into this equation. They greatly decrease the odds of developing cauliflower ear by reducing the damage from impact and friction that grates ears. Studies estimate that the odds of developing cauliflower ears can be decreased by up to 50% with ear guards.</p>

          <p>Some competitors express concern that ear guards can influence the outcome of a grappling match and should thus be banned from tournaments. However, thousands of matches have been conducted in high school and collegiate wrestling matches, as well as submission grappling oriented events such as Grapplersquest, NexusBJJ, and NAGAfighter with few complaints.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">In Conclusion</h2>

          <p>Anyone who embarks on a journey in a grappling sport should take measures to avoid cauliflower ear from the very beginning. To be able to enjoy the full benefits of wrestling, judo, or jiu-jitsu while minimizing the risks and negative consequences of these dangerous sports is a victory to be proud of. The leaders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu should recognize this view and allow competitors to wear ear guards in their tournaments as another step to maximize the health and safety of BJJ participants.
