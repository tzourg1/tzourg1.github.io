          <p>From his <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2016/11/jon-jones-gets-1-year-suspension-from-usada-for-doping-violation-stemming-from-ufc-200" target="_blank">first steroid bust</a> in 2016 for 2 different estrogen blockers, to a <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/12/23/18154355/ufc-232-jon-jones-tests-positive-trace-amount-turinabol-moved-to-california-one-week-out-mma-news" target="_blank">long series of failed drug tests</a> for small amounts of turinabol in his system, to a long list of personal stories from other fighters connecting him to steroid use, the evidence mounted against Jon Jones is preponderant. Yet despite multiple flaggings by USADA and damning accounts made by former friends and training partners that’s comparable to the proof mounted against a burglar who was caught stealing red-handed on video, Jon Jones continues his shameless and pathological campaign of lying, deception, and denial of any use of performance enhancing drugs throughout his career. Worst yet, media superstar Joe Rogan, who has a close relationship with Jon Jones (to the point where <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/10/23/18010784/morning-report-joe-rogan-says-weed-fueled-conversation-might-have-led-jon-jones-to-jacksonwink-mma" target="_blank">they both text each other)</a>, in his usual propagandist fashion, has told millions of his listeners that the episodes that Jon Jones has had with USADA are due to misunderstandings and technicalities that have unfortunately hurt the reputation of an otherwise clean and natural fighter (contrast this with Joe Rogan’s irresponsible remarks about non-American fighters like Mirko Filipovic and <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2376798-joe-rogan-possibility-fedor-emelianenko-used-peds-is-high" target="_blank">Fedor Emelianenko</a> who he will likely never meet in person).</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Overwhelming proof</h2>

          <p>The sherdog user <a href="https://forums.sherdog.com/members/acannxr.534159/" target="_blank">acannxr</a> wonderfully organizes the timeline of Jon Jones’ shady history and here, we’ll copy some of <a href="https://forums.sherdog.com/threads/evidence-of-jones-guilt.3711725/" target="_blank">his notes</a>.
            <ul>
<li>Jan 2015: Greg Howard (who spent a lot of time with Jones to write a comprehensive article on him), reported that Jones was rumored to have hid under the octagon when the drug testers showed up at JacksonWink, prior to the first Cormier fight. In lead-up to that camp, Jones showed a suspiciously low T/E ratio that deviates 80% from his previous reading; the UFC-USADA drug program was not in effect at this time.
</li>
<li>Mar 2016: Frank Mir, teammate of Jon Jones, fails drug test for Oral Turinabol.
  <ul>
Jones allegedly claims to have ingested a penis pill.</li>
<li>The penis pill, however, contained a third banned substance, of which Jones did not test positive for.</li>
<li>Jones claimed his friend gave him the penis pill.</li>
<li>This friend provided an invoice for the purchase of the penis pill, and on the same invoice was an order for Clomiphene (one of the two substances Jones was flagged for).</li>
<li>Common sense dictates that Jones used a middle-man to purchase his PEDs, and bought the penis pill preemptively as an excuse in case he got caught, but never actually ingested the penis pill, otherwise the third banned substance would have shown up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aug 2017: During his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y41Vdgp7ATg" target="_blank">FOX interview</a>, Jones slips up and says that he defeated Cormier "off steroids". His silence afterwards says more than any words could.<li>
Jul 2017: Jones tests positive for Oral Turinabol, the same substance teammate Frank Mir tested positive for back in March of 2016.
</li>
<li>
Feb 2018: During Jones' CSAC hearing, it's discovered that:
<ul>
<li>He failed to report 10 supplements to United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) prior to his performance at UFC 214, despite signing a document that said he did, and that he only disclosed their existence when they were sent to the lab to be tested for banned substances (after his failed drug test).</li>
<li>Jones admitted he never watched mandated tutorials provided by USADA in both 2015 and 2016, instead passing them off to his management to take in his place (including having them forge his signature to confirm that he took said tutorials).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
  From December 2018 to February 2019, Jon Jones then “pissed hot” 7 times for turinabol metabolites. 
</li>
</ul></p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Logical Analysis</h2>


<p>
Occam’s razor is the philosophical principle which holds that the simplest explanation is usually the right one. If you apply this idea to the issue of Jon Jones and steroids, you have to ask yourself- is it more likely that Jon Jones failed dozens of drug tests and has been reported by people to be taking steroids because he actually took steroids before or did he simply fail those drug tests because of careless mishaps such as Joe Rogan’s theory about steroids-contaminated creatine-cocaine (explanation for failing second drug test) and Jon’s explanation of steroid-containing erection enhancement pills (explanation for failing first drug test).  If you’re emotionally biased or intellectually dishonest enough to believe the ridiculous excuses for the dozen failed drug tests given by Jon Jones and Joe Rogan, you’re likely ignoring other important details such as Jon Jones suddenly failing drug tests and being associated with other suspicious events (low T:E levels and reports of hiding from drug-testing agents) right after the UFC implemented random drug-testing protocols. Jon Jones also points to his brothers being in the NFL as evidence that he does not and never has done steroids. The suggestion is that his brothers exemplify his superior genes that allow him to dominate his opponents without performance enhancing drugs. This argument is immediately refuted when we remember that one of the two brothers Jon Jones references, Arthur Jones, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2016/7/22/12260280/jon-jones-brother-nfl-lineman-arthur-jones-suspended-performance-enhancing-drugs-mma" target="_blank">has failed a drug test for steroids himself</a>. 
</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
In conclusion, Jon Jones has obviously done steroids and the propaganda campaign that he has led with support from MMA’s most powerful media personality Joe Rogan has been making a mockery of the truth and the common sense of the public. It also gives other fighters who will fail drug tests in the future the example that continuing to lie and deceit is less consequential than owning up to the truth and coming clean about infractions.
